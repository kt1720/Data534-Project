# Project Daily Report

## Role in the Team

I am responsible for creating wage trend plot to give main idea depending on time and space. 1. This can help users to get the overview about our dataset 2. It can give information about special occupations in different provinces which can help user to better choose the **job location** and know more about the **economic situation** in the past few years.

## Development Decisions

-   Chose to use wage data set. Reason:
    -   As graduate students we need to understand more about the job market
    -   It can also help people who is finding job or looking for better job opportunity
    -   It will show the economic circle and wealth gap
-   Consider using province, year, \*\_wage index
    -   Our group thought these indexes are persuasive and key to the plot
    -   All of us use different ways to clean the data, compring with the format we decide to use Kyle's as template to draw our picture
